this is supposed to be a pokedex for android. Works using GLIDE and other sources to search through a json file of all the different pokemon and then displays them to the user as preferred. Still needs some tweaking, will be patching over the next few days. ALso I still haven't figured how to include screenshots so those will be coming in soon
